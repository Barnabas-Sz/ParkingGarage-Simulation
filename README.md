# ParkingGarage-Sim
This is a Parking Garage Simulation created by Barnabas Szelenyi. 

# What does the Code do?
When you run the code, the terminal pops up and car 1. enters the Garage. A ticket with a unique ID is issued to the car. The Free Spaces in the Garage are then updated, to show that one free space has been taken away. This process happens 5 Times. After all 5 cars are in the garage, the programm waits 2 Seconds until the Cars start to leave the Garage. It identifies the Car with its Unique ID, calculates the Fee based on the Time spent in the Garage. If the Payment is succesfull, The Car exits the Garage and a Free space is now added again. This process happens 5 times until all Cars have payed and left the Garage. Then there are 5 free spaces in the Garage again, and the programm ends.
